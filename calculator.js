 * This is the JavaScript module for our Three Digit Integer Calculator

 * A JavaScript module is a way for us to organize our code so that everything
 * is not in the global namespace. In the old days, when someone wrote a
 * function named "calculate" and you used their code then you wrote a function
 * named "calculate" they would collide and one of those functions would be
 * overwritten. Modules help us prevent that by namespacing (grouping under a
 * name) our functions.
 *
 * Mozilla has a great description and background on about JavaScript modules.
